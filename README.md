# is216-project
## How to Run
This project is using vue. So have to run it as an npm.

1. cd to `Pawsitive/` directory
2. run `npm install` (only for first time running!)
3. Then run `npm run dev`

Afterwards, you can continue editting and saved changes will auto hot reload in the browser.
Subsequent launches when working on the project you can omit step 2
