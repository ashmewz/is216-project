## Business Problem

Community cat welfare in Singapore relies heavily on the goodwill of our residents. Still, current practices do not utilise technology much: handwritten notes in void decks, informal WhatsApp, etc. These efforts, while sincere, often lack structure and continuity. For example, one group of residents may update each other via WhatsApp about feeding times, but the information rarely extends beyond the chat. Similarly, spotters of injured cats may post a picture online, but without a centralised log, the follow-up care depends on chance visibility.
There is no consistent system for logging on feeding schedules or medical emergencies, no transparent way to coordinate among multiple volunteers, and no simple platform to sustain community engagement beyond the few who already commit time and money. Also, opportunities for broader participation like crowdfunding are scattered, inaccessible to the wider public who may wish to contribute.
Our project addresses these issues by providing a unified Community Cat Welfare Tracker that empowers volunteers and our communities to help these felines. In doing so, it transforms fragmented, low-tech practices into a sustainable, transparent, and community-driven system of shared responsibility for Singapore‚Äôs beloved community cats.

## Developers Setup Guide

Comprehensive steps to help other developers or evaluators run and test your project.

---

### 0) Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.4+  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ and npm v9+  
- [Vue.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ and npm v9+  
<!-- - Access to backend or cloud services used (Firebase, MongoDB Atlas, AWS S3, etc.) -->

---

### 1) Download and run the Vue Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashmewz/is216-project.git
cd Pawsitive
npm install
```

### 2) Run the Frontend
To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The project will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

<!-- To build and preview the production version:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
``` -->


### 2) Running Stripe server
This project uses a 2nd server (backend) to run the Stripe embedding. We have to run a server using Node.

All these needs to be run in the Pawsitive directory (so make sure you are in that folder, else cd to `Pawsitive/` directory)
1. Check if Node & npm are installed on your machine. `node -v` and `npm -v` separately
2. Node modules are required locally too. Run `npm install`
3. In Pawsitive directory, run `node server/server.js` which will run in port 4242 
4. Open another powershell/terminal using '+' and run `npm run dev` to run the frontend site in port 5173

In the donations page, select the donation amount, then "Continue".
Your 2nd server would have a log something like: `üí∞ Received donation amount: 12`

Testing card numbers can be found from this stripe documentation: `https://docs.stripe.com/testing`
Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Card expiry: 12/34
Card CVC: 567

Upon "Donate Now" success, you will currently be directed to a blank page, with the following browser path pattern:
`http://localhost:5173/donate/success?payment_intent=pi_3SI1WnA4UE4DKmEO0KHD04IZ&payment_intent_client_secret=pi_3SI1WnA4UE4DKmEO0KHD04IZ_secret_g26E0UQS8m7bJ1aUh70EQcleP&redirect_status=succeeded`
In future this should redirect back to some other page. But this has yet to be implemented. (CAA 14 Oct 2025)


## Testing AI Recognition Page
You must have a VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY value in your .env file.
ENV files are git ignored. Please get the gemini API key from Kevan.
The key allows for up to 50 per day and resets.

To test:
1. Load the page.
2. Grab a random cat image from google and upload it.
3. Click "Run cat prediction".
You will see a prediction of what cat breed the image is with a probability/confidence percentage.
And then afterwards you will also see the generated care tips from Gemini API.

---

<!-- ### 2) Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following structure:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=<your_backend_or_firebase_url>
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<your_firebase_api_key>
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<your_auth_domain>
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<your_storage_bucket>
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<your_sender_id>
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<your_app_id>
```

> Never commit the `.env` file to your repository.  
> Instead, include a `.env.example` file with placeholder values.

---

### 3) Backend / Cloud Service Setup

#### Firebase
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project.
3. Enable the following:
   - **Authentication** ‚Üí Email/Password sign-in
   - **Firestore Database** or **Realtime Database**
   - **Hosting (optional)** if you plan to deploy your web app
4. Copy the Firebase configuration into your `.env` file.

#### Optional: Express.js / MongoDB
If your app includes a backend:
1. Create a `/server` folder for backend code.
2. Inside `/server`, create a `.env` file with:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret_key>
   ```
3. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

---

### 4) Run the Frontend
To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The project will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

To build and preview the production version:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

### 5) Testing the Application

#### Manual Testing
Perform the following checks before submission:

| Area | Test Description | Expected Outcome |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Authentication | Register, Login, Logout | User successfully signs in/out |
| CRUD Operations | Add, Edit, Delete data | Database updates correctly |
| Responsiveness | Test on mobile & desktop | Layout adjusts without distortion |
| Navigation | All menu links functional | Pages route correctly |
| Error Handling | Invalid inputs or missing data | User-friendly error messages displayed |

#### Automated Testing (Optional)
If applicable:
```bash
npm run test
```

---

### 6) Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `Module not found` | Missing dependencies | Run `npm install` again |
| `Firebase: permission-denied` | Firestore security rules not set | Check rules under Firestore ‚Üí Rules |
| `CORS policy error` | Backend not allowing requests | Enable your domain in CORS settings |
| `.env` variables undefined | Missing `VITE_` prefix | Rename variables to start with `VITE_` |
| `npm run dev` fails | Node version mismatch | Check Node version (`node -v` ‚â• 18) |
